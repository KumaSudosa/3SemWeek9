# Wednesday
this part is the "REST with JAX RS" assignment. I have completed most parts: Facade, endpoints, tests, error handling etc,
but haven't always completed the yellow/red parts.

# Friday
This part is the "Object Relational Mapping with JPA" assignment. I should have completed it all, bar the
"Find all Orders for a specific Customer" and "Find the total price of an order" which are marked yellow and red respectively.
